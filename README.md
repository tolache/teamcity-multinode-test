# TeamCity Multinode Test
## This is a work in progress
This is an example of how to configure a TeamCity multinode setup on Ubuntu 18.04 with docker.
It will run two TeamCity nodes, MySQL server, and an NFS server, all in docker containers on the same host.
This setup is only good for testing and demonstration purposes.
